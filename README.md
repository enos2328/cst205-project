# hungy

### A CST205 final project web application! This code was made to create a web application named Hungy that would help you find recipes. If you want to avoid visiting the store, then you can enter the ingredients that you already have, and you will be given recipes that use the ingredients that you have and limit the use of missing ingrediencies. Otherwise, there is another option if you want to use up most of your ingredients before you go on a trip or something, the API will try to use as many ingrediencies as it can. You can also enter the name of the food you want (ex: Lasagna), and you will be given different recipes of Lasagna.

# How to use it:
### Step 1: go to requirements.txt to see what you will need to install to run the application.
### Step 2: pip install the things you are missing.
### Step 3: download/clone the porject to your computer.
### Step 4: run API.py in your python interpreter.
### Step 5: open your webrowser and type http://127.0.0.1:5000.
### Step 6: make yourself a great meal!
