# hungy

### A CST205 final project web application! This code was made to create a web application named Hungy that would help you find recipes. If you want to avoid visiting the store, then you can enter the ingredients that you already have and you will be given recipes that use the ingredients that you have. Otherwise, there is another option if you don't mind having to go to the store and you already know what you want to make. You can enter the name of the food you want (ex: Lasagna), and you will be given different recipes of Lasagna.
